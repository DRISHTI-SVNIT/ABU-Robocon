      <h1>What is ROBOCON?</h1>
      <p>
        The ABU Asia-Pacific Robot Contest (ABU Robocon) is an Asian-Oceanian
        college robot competition. Robots compete to complete a task within a
        set period, usually 3 minutes. The competition has over 20 countries in
        its domain, influencing and imbibing the flame of robotics among the
        youth. Each year the competition has a different problem statement based
        on the hosting country's culture or global problems. There are two
        phases to the competition: the national round, which selects the college
        or team that will represent the nation abroad, and the final round,
        which takes place the last week of August each year. Twenty nations
        compete in the ultimate round.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since 2002, Team DRISHTI has participated in DD Robocon and set a higher
        benchmark for itself each year.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Team Drishti representing NIT Surat has been participating in this
        competition since 2002 and has set a higher benchmark for itself each
        year. In Robocon 2018, team Drishti ranked 12th on the national stage
        among 108 nationwide. In Robocon 2019, we ranked 13th on the national
        stage. In Robocon 2020, we achieved a score of 98/100 and were among the
        79 teams out of 93 who cleared the first round. In Robocon 2021, for the
        first time in 16 years of Drishti participating in Robocon, we scored
        100/100 for the round one submission.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In Robocon 2022 we scored 97/100 in stage 1. In 2023, after successfully
        clearing stage 1 and 2, we were ranked 21st among 40 teams nationwide in
        stage 3 held at IIT Delhi.

            The theme of ABU Robocon 2023- “Casting Flowers Over Angkor Wat” is
            a game involving two robots, namely a Rabbit robot (RR) and an
            Elephant Robot(ER), working in coordination to toss the rings onto
            the poles effectively. To comply with the problem statement, the ER
            has distinct features like a holonomic drive and various subsystems.
            The subsystems include the picking and loading mechanism, feeding
            mechanism, and throwing mechanism. The RR design requirements are
            similar to ER, with an efficient mecanum drive that can climb the
            wedge to reach the Angkor Wat area. Both robots have semi-autonomous
            functioning, and all mechanisms are designed to abide by the rule
            book to accomplish various tasks.

            The theme of ABU Robocon 2022 was "Lagori", a traditional game from
            southern India that was popular in the 1990s. The game is played
            between two teams, "Seeker" and "Hitter", with the Seeker throwing a
            ball to break a stone tower called "Lagori". The Hitter then throws
            balls to interrupt the Seeker.

            In 2021, ABU Robocon’s problem statement was based on "Throwing
            arrows into pots,” traditional etiquette and game in ancient China.
            It is a game of two robots collaborating to score points by throwing
            arrows into five different pots. Each team has a TR, the throwing
            robot, and a DR, the defensive robot. The game area is divided into
            two areas: inner and outer. The TR is bound to only the outer area,
            but the DR is free to move in any area of the team. The TR is
            allowed to throw and pass the arrows while the DR is permitted to
            pitch, intercept the pots and pick up arrows. When a team throws two
            arrows in a pot, it’s called twinning, and the game ends if any of
            the team can achieve twinning in all five pots. Otherwise, the team
            which performs the maximum score wins.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We designed all the mechanisms of both robots with semi-autonomous
            functioning to accomplish various tasks. The approach explicitly
            maintained a probability distribution over the robot's possible
            locations, taking into account multiple sources of uncertainty,
            including approximate knowledge of the environment and actuators and
            sensors uncertainty. Acknowledging various game plans and their
            consequences, both Throwing Robot (TR) and Defensive Robot (DR)
            would score points by throwing the arrows to the desired pot. Along
            with throwing, DR would also perform defensive tasks.

            The ABU Robocon 2020 contest was to play rugby 7’s game using two
            robots and five obstacles as five defending players. This game's
            primary and unique challenge was Goal Kick, kicking the Kick Ball
            over the conversion post’s crossbar because of the rugby ball’s
            unique shape. Each team had two robots known as Pass Robot (PR) and
            Try Robot (TR). The PR picks up one Try Ball from the Ball Rack and
            passes the Try Ball from the Passing Zone to TR located in the
            Receiving Zone. The TR then goes along the five defending Obstacles
            to score the Try in one of the five Try Spots. After a successful
            Try by TR, it took a kick step from the Kicking Zone to make the
            Goal. The game continues until all the seven Kick Balls were used or
            when the 3 minutes passed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our Try Robot did the kicking process, and a team member manually
            placed the Kick Ball. The kicking Mechanism is inspired by a human
            leg, and it mimics the motion of the leg kicking a ball. Then the TR
            traveled to the Receiving Zone’s required position to receive the
            Try Ball. It had a damping system and an aligning system. Meanwhile,
            the PR traveled towards the Ball Rack and picked up the first Try
            Ball with the help of a gripper mechanism. After the TR reached the
            required position, it signaled the PR to pass the Try Ball. On a
            successful receive of the Try Ball, the TR traveled to the desired
            Try Spot avoiding the obstacles using a Path Planning Algorithm.
            Further, the TR placed the Try Ball in the Try Spot. After a
            successful Try, a team member put a Kick Ball in the Kicking Zone,
            and then the TR moved to kick the Ball.

            The problem statement in 2019 was based on Mongolia's tradition of a
            message relay system. The theme “GREAT URTUU- message relaying
            system” required two messengers to coordinate the effective transfer
            of the message. To comply with the problem statement, the MR1 robot
            had distinct features like a holonomic drive and various subsystems.
            The subsystems included a Gerege holding and passing mechanism, an
            intercepting mechanism for receiving the Gerege, and a lever-based
            throwing mechanism. The MR2 design requirements were a robotic
            replication of a horse, i.e., a 4-legged robot, carrying the message
            through various obstacles. MR2 was responsible for completing the
            final task and convey the message of victory to the world by raising
            the Gerege. Our efforts in fulfilling the problem statement resulted
            in developing a modified Klann mechanism for the MR2.
